***Summary*** : This repo was created with the intention to study the basics of Blazor, C# and WebAssembly, utilizing these tools to make a simple portfolio. <br>
The reason to use these technologies is that I'm interested to use programming languages to the browser, and I look forward to see the potential and the different scenarios it can be built with ðŸ”¥.
